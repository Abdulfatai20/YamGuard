YamGuard – Intelligent Yam Storage Advisor
=============

YamGuard is a smart mobile-based assistant designed to help yam farmers in Southwestern Nigeria reduce post-harvest losses. The app offers personalized storage recommendations based on weather forecasts, yam condition, and storage duration. It integrates machine learning, real-time data, and intuitive design to support informed storage decisions.

=============  
Features  
=============

1. **User Authentication**  
   Secure user registration and login with Firebase Authentication.

2. **Weather Forecasting**  
   Uses OpenWeatherMap API to provide: 🔗 https://openweathermap.org
   - Real-time weather data and storage advice based on today's forecast conditions 
   - 7-day forecast for key climate indicators

3. **Forecast-Based Storage Recommendation**  
   Suggests best storage methods (barn, pit, ash/sawdust, crate) based on:
   - Yam type and condition (whole/cut)
   - Forecast duration (14/30/60/90 days)
   - Trained Prophet models for average temperature, humidity, rainfall, and max temperature

4. **Educational Yam Info Module**  
   Offers brief content on yam types, traditional storage techniques, and best practices.

5. **Alerts & Notifications** 
   Sends intelligent warnings:
   - Dry Season and Wet Season alerts 
   - Extreme Weather notifications sent two days in advance

Tech Stack  
=============

Frontend: Flutter  
Backend: FastAPI (deployed on Render)  
Forecasting Model: Prophet (Facebook open-source)  
Weather API: OpenWeatherMap  
Authentication: Firebase 🔗 https://firebase.google.com
Cloud Database: Firestore (Firebase)  
Deployment (Frontend): Flutter APK  
Deployment (Backend): Render
The backend is fully developed in Python, leveraging the FastAPI framework for building high-performance APIs.

Backend Info
=============
FastAPI Backend (for Recommendations)

Recommendation Endpoint (POST)
 **How to Test the FastAPI Backend via Swagger UI which can be used to test the backend in the browser

🔗 Swagger UI URL: https://yamguard.onrender.com/docs

This link opens a Swagger interface where the API endpoints can be tested without writing any code.

Steps to Test the Storage Recommendation Endpoint
Open this link in a browser:
👉 https://yamguard.onrender.com/docs

Scroll to the POST /recommendation/ section.
Click to expand it.

Click “Try it out”.

Enter sample input like below:

{
  "yam_type": "white yam",
  "condition": whole
  "duration": 30_day
}
(Replace values as needed: "whole" or "cut" for condition, duration can be 14_day, 30_day, 60_day, or 90_day, white yam, yellow yam, water yam or bitter for the yam_type)

Click “Execute”.

You will get a JSON response with:

-Recommended storage method

-Forecast Summary for the selected duration

-Indoor/outdoor advice

-Wet or Dry Season Alert 

-Reasons Why other storage methods were not selected


Yam Types Endpoint (GET)
Returns available yam varieties and related metadata. Can be tested directly in the browser.

API Hosting Dashboard (Render)
The backend is hosted and live here: 🔗 https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d1m8pf2dbo4c73f1sk20

Dataset 
=============

Weather Dataset (used to train Prophet models):  
📊 [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RFmep1gG5UVLADiXheArLUYHs82hp4PNVxPmovsznuo/edit)  
(Source: Meteostat, Data from 2023 to June 2025) 🔗 https://dev.meteostat.net
 

=============
Prequisite 
=============
Flutter SDK ≥ 3.0 needs to be installed  🔗 https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

Git for cloning the project 🔗 https://git-scm.com/

=============
Installation
=============
1- Clone the repository - git https://github.com/Abdulfatai20/YamGuard.git
2- Install dependencies - flutter pub get
3- Run the app - flutter run
✅ No Python installation required
The backend with the trained Prophet model is already deployed via Render.

Optional: Run Backend Locally

If you want to run the FastAPI backend and Prophet model locally instead of using the deployed Render API:

Install Python 3.10+ (v3.13.2 is recommended as its used for this project) (if not already installed)
You can check with:
python --version

Navigate to backend folder
cd fastapi_backend

Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate

Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the backend
uvicorn main:app --reload

The FastAPI backend is already deployed on Render, so they don’t need to run it locally unless they want to.

The Flutter app already points to the deployed URL (https://yamguard.onrender.com/recommendation/).

If they do run it locally, it will default to http://127.0.0.1:8000.


YamGuard already includes the Firebase configuration file (lib/firebase_options.dart) generated by the FlutterFire CLI.
No manual Firebase setup is required unless you are creating a new Firebase project.


=============
YamGuard Deployment APK
=============
The app has already been built and included in the /build folder.
File: YamGuard_v1.apk
flutter apk build 
Copy it to any Android phone and install directly to begin testing.
